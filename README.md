This is an old, out-of-date version of the Morpheus morphological parser for Latin and Greek

The current, up-to-date repository for Morpheus is here: https://github.com/PerseusDL/morpheus

The current version of Morpheus has a bug which has led to a significant regression whereby many Greek words are not parsed at all or are not parsed correctly.  Until that bug is fixed, this old version of Morpheus is provided so that Diogenes can build against it.
